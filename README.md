# Chicago_Housing_Price_Segmentation_and_Determinants

Hi eveyrone! 

We hope you all have a good day and we appreciate you spending time here! This repository contain mine and Jason Tran (tran_j6@denison.edu) analysis of the Chicago housing market. Specifically, we analyze Chicago community areas housing data levels to segment and determine the main drivers of house price between different areas. 

The dataset is included in the respository under the folders: cmap data, and dataset. The source and citation of the dataset is included in the final paper (which is in html format)

This readme file is here to help setting up mine and Jason R code file. More specifically, the code file would be abled to knit on its own given full download of all used packages, which located in the 1st R chunk (exclude the set up directory chunk); and correct paths of all downloaded dataset. 

Since we downloaded the datasets into our local devices, thus, you would have to change the URL into the correct paths in your device. The R chunks to change to paths of datasets are chunks 2, which contains the paths for all csv files, and chunk 3, which contains the path for the only xlsx file. 

The rest of the R code file should be able to work and knit on it own. 

We hope you would learn something about Chicago after reading this project! 
Hao Nguyen & Jason Tran
